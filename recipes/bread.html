    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This banana zucchini bread combines two of my favorites: banana walnut bread and zucchini bread. <br> I like to add dried cranberries for an extra boost of flavor in every bite. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs: Three eggs add moisture and help hold the batter together.</li>
            <li>Oil: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, lends even more moisture.</li>
            <li>Sugars: This banana zucchini bread recipe calls for both brown and white sugars.</li>
            <li>Zucchini and bananas: Of course, you'll need grated zucchini and mashed bananas!</li>
            <li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of this simple quick bread.</li>
            <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the banana zucchini bread structure.</li>
            <li>Cinnamon: Ground cinnamon lends welcome pleasant warmth.</li>
            <li>Leaveners: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the bread rise.</li>
            <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make your bread taste salty.</li>
            <li>Cranberries: Dried cranberries give the bread bursts of fruity flavor.</li>
            <li>Walnuts: Chopped walnuts add crunch and nutty flavor.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat the eggs, then beat in the wet ingredients.</li>
            <li>Stir in the dry ingredients, then fold in the cranberries and nuts.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into prepared pans and bake until a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
        </ol>
